                Effective Date: October 26, 2023

                <br><br>
                Welcome to Suggesto Amigo, the next-gen social media platform! By using our platform, you agree to the following terms:
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Eligibility</b>
                <br>
                Users must be over 18 years of age to use our platform.
                We collect and process the following user data: name, last name, hashed password, email, and post data.

                <br><br>
                <b>2. User Conduct</b>

                <br>
                Respectful behavior is essential; any account not behaving respectfully may be suspended or banned.
                Prohibited content includes NSFW content and disrespectful content.
                Bullying and harassment of other users are not tolerated.

                <br><br>
                <b>3. Consequences for Violations</b>
                <br>

                Violations may result in being banned from our platform.
                As a playful warning, we might send an email to your parents (⊙_⊙) if you misbehave.

                <br><br>
                <b>4. Data Privacy</b>

                <br>
                Unlike TikTok, we do not sell user data or track every step/action you take.
                We collect only the bare minimum data necessary because we're next-gen.

                <br><br>
                <b>5. Content Ownership</b>
                <br>
                
                Users retain ownership of the content they post.
                Users are responsible for the consequences of their content.

                <br><br>
                <b>6. Account Removal</b>
                <br>
                We're still working on an account removal feature.
                For assistance, contact us at suggesto.amigo@gmail.com; we'll do our best to help you promptly.

                <br><br>
                <b>7. Updates to Terms</b>
                <br>
                
                If we update our terms of service, you'll find the changes on this page, which can be accessed on the registration page.
                (Last update of terms: October 26, 2023)
